</h1><p>I’m a journalist with experience mapping audience/user needs to editorial decisions and product strategy. Most recently, I was a product strategist at Google News, focusing on news ranking and quality, after five years at The Washington Post as its News Analytics editor. 
 </p>
                     <p>Throughout my career, I’ve been driven by the dual missions of helping everyone have access to high quality news, and helping publishers become sustainable through understanding their audiences’ needs. I’ve been able to work on these challenges in many different capacities over the years by leveraging my skills in audience development, data analytics, product strategy, and user experience research in both newsrooms and product tech companies.
</p>
                     <p>I’m currently on the hunt for something new, hoping to bring my mix of skills to the right team. Welcome!</p>
