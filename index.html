</h1><p>I’m a journalist with experience mapping audience needs to editorial decisions and strategy. <span style="background:rgba(251, 243, 219, 1)">Currently, I’m a product experience strategist for news at Google</span> after five years at The Washington Post as its News Analytics assignment editor. </p>
                     <p>I’ve built my career at the intersection of news, data, and product, and am a fierce believer that we can always improve the way we collaborate to promote inclusivity and empathy.</p>
