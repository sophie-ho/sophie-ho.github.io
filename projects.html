                  <p><u><a href="https://opennews.org/what/community/dei-coalition/">DEI Coalition For Anti-Racist, Equitable, And Just Newsrooms:</a></u> I worked with 100+ journalists to build the #DEICoalition, a digital community for journalists who want to work toward a future where our newsrooms are anti-racist, equitable, just, and inclusive. I was one of four committee leads who ran point on the project.</p><p> My committee focused on safety and moderation, specifically thinking through how the community should be built to help prioritize the physical and psychological safety of members by making everyone feel welcome and supported. We crafted <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xzZlzvUkbGCb9EjYrLUx_QSpSGCAgSY8UuXqsxBGB3Q/edit">the Community Agreements</a> for the community, as well as the effective response framework for moderators. I learned a lot on how to optimize for asychronous work and how to run productive Zoom meetings, as this project took place during the height of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic.
