                  <div class="title"> <p>I'm Sophie Ho, the editor of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/pr/2021/04/01/washington-posts-sophie-ho-named-news-analytics-assignment-editor/"><u>News Analytics</a></u> at The Washington Post. At The Post, we recognize that metrics can and should be another data point to help guide strategy and tactics at all levels. The News Analytics team helps set standards for how reporters and editors across the newsroom can use analytics and metrics to inform editorial decisions; we craft the vision for which metrics matter and why, as well as build tools and trainings to support our journalists.</p>
                  <p>I’ve spent most of my professional career at The Washington Post. I joined The Post in 2016 as an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/pr/wp/2016/08/29/sophie-ho-named-hub-engagement-editor/"><u>engagement editor on the Universal News Desk</a></u> after a summer as an intern on the Audience Engagement team. In 2018, I was a founding member of the Operations team, doing stints working with Financial and National/Politics, where I trained reporters and editors on audience best practices and led SEO strategy for breaking news events. In 2019, I returned to the Audience Engagement team as the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/pr/2018/12/11/sophie-ho-promoted-newsroom-audience-analyst/"><u>first newsroom audience analyst.</u></a></p>
                  <p>Before The Post, I interned at media organizations like AJ+, documentary company Loteria Films, alt-weekly East Bay Express and radio station WTOP. I learned how to report and produce journalism in different mediums, and was fascinated with how each organization approached and targeted audiences, which eventually prompted me to pursue audience engagement full-time. </p>
                  <p>I grew up in the Bay Area and studied Political Science at UC Berkeley (Go Bears!). I live in D.C. and can give you a very detailed list of food recommendations should you ever need it. I am very opinionated on where to get Vietnamese food in the DMV and Bay Area.

<h4>How to get in touch</h4>
<p>You can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/sophanho"><u>Twitter</u></a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sophie-ho-3ab75245/"><u>Linkedin,</u></a> where I check my messages fairly frequently.</p>
<h4>About this website</h4>
<p>This is my first attempt at building a website, with most of it actually being done by my stellar partner. The theme of this website is Github user heiswayi’s <a href="https://github.com/heiswayi/the-plain">Plain theme.</a> I like how minimal the theme is and how it renders on mobile. The favicon is from <a href="https://thenounproject.com/">The Noun Project</a>. I initially built this to be a more detailed Twitter bio, but have since expanded the website to include some projects and speaking engagements that don't really fit on my Linkedin (which is otherwise the home for all my professional experience).
